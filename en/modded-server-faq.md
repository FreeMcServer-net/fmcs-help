## How do I create a modded server?

Follow the guide below to create a modded server:

1. Go to JAR/Version and choose `custom JAR` for the JAR and choose `N/A` for the Version.

2. Delete everything using Filezilla or WebFTP and download an updated eula.txt file [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/588341478296911892/623639791506030643/eula.txt) and upload with no changes needed.

3. Download the `installer` from the official minecraft forge website [here](https://files.minecraftforge.net/).

4. Once the download has finished, double click the `installer` and choose install `server` and the file it should extract to. I recommend choosing another folder other than the default folder.

5. Once the installer has finished, before you go uploading the files and folders, rename the `forge-universal.jar` file to `custom.jar` or **IT WILL NOT WORK**.

6. Now upload the `custom.jar`, `minecraft_server.jar` and `libraries` folder to the `JAR` folder using Filezilla **NOT** WebFTP as it does not allow the uploading of folders. A guide on how to get and use Filezilla is [here](en/#how-to-get-and-use-the-recommended-ftp-client).

7. Restart the server and now you're done!
